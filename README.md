Where is your organization in its Learning journey?
AURA, or Aware, understand, refine, and Apply, is a four-phase process designed to help organizations build and deliver training. The reality of any training program is that the initial phase (Aware) is often easier than the other phases overall. But that is because organizations don’t always consider the reality of the information they can mine from Aware. The AURA model, a training process built to help you, is designed around two core concepts. It should be noted that while this iteration of AURA is focused on building AI Training, AURA is flexible and can be used in all adult learning scenarios.
•	How can we remove the FUD?
•	Who in our organization is interested in what we are teaching
Removing the FUD allows the organization to consider, present, and validate information that helps employees reduce concerns and fears. FUD, more broadly called Fear, uncertainty, and doubt, often plagues adopting a new technology or a modified solution.  Based on the FUD, Awareness helps the organization modify that belief through activities designed around replacing fear with information.
•	Fear – this is new and scary
•	Uncertainty – I’ve heard that this solution isn’t baked yet
•	Doubt – why would I use this?
Removing fear can be painful. Learning is a process; sometimes, it has to involve unlearning or relearning things that are repeated or previously covered in different modes. That is why the Awareness phase of AURA is stand-alone and self-driven. It is “guided” in the sense of a planned outcome and provided materials. However, it is also independent, allowing users to consider, evaluate, and move forward at their own pace.  At the end of lesson 1, there is a self-check section. This allows the organization to verify that the learners have moved forward rather than consuming content without engaging.
Based on that, ongoing organizational recommendations are embedded throughout the AURA model. Organizational Callout will be labeled exactly that (Organizational Callout)/ AURA is a training model. The initial releases demonstrates what you can do with the model. The four phases are detailed below. The model's initial “iteration” is designed to deliver AI training to the organization.

Learning Goals of Awareness
1.	How can I use the existing AI tools on the market now?
2.	How can I use the tools my organization builds when available?
3.	What needs to be added when doing my job?
Organizational learning goals
1.	How do we remove the FUD around the topic?
2.	Who in our organization is interested in the topic?
3.	Who in the organization will help us build the new solution?
Creative Technology and Innovation has built a plan to solve these questions for you question for you. The reality is that the other two questions will also start to be answered. 
As your organization embarks on our four-phase training model, please note that it is highly recommended that you do not consider a step-by-step path. Awareness is intended to increase your interest as you learn about AI.
One of the core components of this overall process is the AI concept of RAG. You are focused on making data. Retrieval augmented ready to be reused. Since this is a training plan to help you learn about AI rag, it is a term that you will run into frequently. However, the goal of this initial training segment, or what we call awareness, is to help the learner build the framework by which they can implement a mental rag model in the future. In other words, we will use a concept-generated AI to improve retention and ability to function with information and use that to help human beings better understand what they are doing. While we are building an AI training or AI awareness model, we are using a RAG structure for that model.
In creating an awareness model, we intend to expand that with you beyond awareness. However, awareness of the RAG Framework we use for AURA is critical. Why is it critical? Training is about understanding where people are regarding the information they want or get. If we consider a learner between 8 and 9 years old, they operate in a more concrete operational phase. How you introduce information to someone at that state is very different than the formal operational stage learners move into as they are older. (Piaget's model is included in Appendix 1) The Awareness or Aware phase of AURA intends to help the learner build the Retrieval Augmented Generation structure they can use as they embark on an AI learning career.
It should be noted that many learners in your organization will not move beyond awareness. It should also be noted that awareness as it exists in 2024 will be different from the awareness of 2026. Your learners may be in a loop of going through awareness every 6-12 months and never moving to the next phase.
Training by role and by department
This is generic in the sense that it is broad role categories. The intent is to show organizational roles and the level of AI training to be applied. This model is for a company leveraging AI. The sales requirement will change if the company sells or delivers AI services. In an organization that sells an AI-focused or AI-augmented tool, the requirement for sales would move to Understanding.

Anyone can step outside of their “area” to learn more about AI. The intent of this alignment is to guide an organization in who should attend. Traditionally, the organization would roll this training out from a top-down perspective. We would recommend releasing Aware training to those with the greatest fear AI will replace their jobs first.

 The goal and structure of this training model, starting with awareness, is based on the concepts outlined in the AI section on the AI concept of RAG. Awareness focused on building sections 1-4 in the above AI generated what is RAG. We will help you build a Retrieval model in awareness so that you will understand what AI is. You will understand and have a framework to align with what you are learning. This allows you to add new and interesting information to your current knowledge. As your organization embarks on this learning Journey (AURA), keep in mind allowing for feedback loops to redirect the learning process in the latter part of the journey.
What this means for you that we will present is extremely broad. When I first became a software architect many years ago, a mile-wide HD was used to describe what architects were. You knew many things about many things, and you didn't have greater death on many things. Now, the reality is that most operatives have areas where they are extremely technical. Based on that, the structure we will leverage intends to utilize the four phases of our training model and help you build a structural lag model to support your learning. To put it in layperson's terms is to make it easier to understand or comprehend what we will do to help you with an age-old problem. If you go outside and fill a bucket with sudsy water and wash it close, what you need for those close to driving well, I do need to go back inside and use the dryer, or you need a close line to hang the close on. Before you wash the clothes, it's important to note whether you have a dryer or are using a close line. Because that close line becomes your frame of reference, from an educational sense, our rag educational system would help you build an NAI close line so that in the future, you can successfully utilize the information you have!
The goal of AURA is to have easy to follow self paced learning the organization can have users attempt on their own. Not all learners are good at self-paced
